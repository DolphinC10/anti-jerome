       This site is to document the growth of the Anti-Jerome Opening. It was made as an alternative to the Giuoco Piano and Two Knights Defense, both of which are subject to dangerous gambits, being the Jerome Gambit and Fried Liver Attack respectively.

        The Anti-Jerome opening is a response to the italian game as black. The sequence is <b>1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4</b>, and black plays the rather strange <b>3... Nh6?!</b>. While this looks much better for white, it is definitely playable and there is much less theory developed here. It would be very easy to catch an opponent off guard and get a strong attack or relatively equal endgame.

        There's a dangerous line a lot of beginner players might fall into. <b>1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nh6 4. 0-0 d6 5. d4 Bg4 6. dxe5 Nxe5 7. Qe2 Bxf3 8. gxf3 Qh4</b>. White has given themself a weak king, and developing normally like most beginners are told will most likely result in checkmate. <b>9. Be3 d5 10. Bxd5 Bd6 11. Nc3</b>. Black now has forced checkmate in 3 moves. <b>11... Nxf3+</b>. It is easy to see the checkmate on h2 if white captures the knight or plays Kh1. <b>12. Kg2 Qxh2+ 13. Kxf3 Qh3#</b>. A rare line, but somewhat easy to fall into if you're not paying attention, especially in blitz or bullet.
